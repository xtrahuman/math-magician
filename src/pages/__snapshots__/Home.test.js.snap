    Given that math content is immersed in a linguistic medium, we wondered whether one of the languages of bilinguals is a preferred vehicle for math and, importantly, whether this linguistic context always remains on the surface or at some point merges with numerical representation.

    Geometry is initially the study of spatial figures like circles and cubes, though it has been generalized considerably. Topology developed from geometry; it looks at those properties that do not change even when the figures are deformed by stretching and bending, like dimension.

    A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives. In a dynamical system, a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.
